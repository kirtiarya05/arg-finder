##  Scientific Background
Antibiotic resistance is a major global health concern. Detecting resistance genes in bacterial genomes helps researchers and clinicians understand resistance mechanisms and guide treatment strategies.

This project performs **in-silico screening** of DNA sequences for resistance-associated motifs.
